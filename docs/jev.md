# Real Jev in Decision Theater

The theater can call TypeSafe's real `jev-latest` model directly. Set `JEV_KEY`
in the root `.env` (or `TYPESAFE_API_KEY`, which takes precedence), run
`npm run build && npm run start:demos:live`, then select **Jev · TypeSafe**.
The key stays on the server. Models without credentials are disabled. Jev-only
configuration works; when both providers are configured, Qwen remains the default.
Restart an existing production server after rebuilding and refresh its browser tab.

This is a theater integration, not a change to the standalone compatibility API.
The standalone proxy's historical `jev-latest` alias still selects Cerebras.
The theater's Jev option instead sends `POST https://api.typesafe.ai/v1/systemone`
with the TypeSafe credential, never through that alias. The UI labels the provider
**TYPESAFE / JEV**. Exports retain both the requested alias and the actual returned
model revision (for example `jev-1.13.0`).

## Same scenes, native questions

Both providers use the same synthetic inputs, allowed actions, navigation graph,
physics, home state, rubric criteria and final scene validators. Native Jev asks
all questions for an item together in **one HTTP request**, with shared state.

| Scene | Native mapping |
| --- | --- |
| Tickets | Choice for team, priority and action; Noul for escalation |
| Routing | Choice among the current legal directions |
| Driving | Choice for steering and throttle |
| Guardrails / approvals | Choice between allow and block |
| Scoring | One Noul per weighted criterion, plus Noul for complete validity |
| Home | Choice for apply/clarify, four lights, blinds and allowed temperature |

Choice labels map directly, including numeric temperature labels. Noul becomes
true only when its probability is **strictly greater than 0.5**; a tie is false.
Scoring adds each criterion's existing points when its Noul passes that threshold.
This preserves the integer 0–100 output contract without pretending a native
weighted Score is an exact point total. The separate display threshold remains
strict `accuracy > 90` by default and is adjustable without inference.

The mapping is **`jev-scenes-v1`**. All native answers, probabilities and confidence
values remain in session exports, alongside the exact native request, returned
model revision, question count, usage, real timings and local decision. The contract
dialog shows native Choice/Noul questions and the actual `/v1/systemone` request.
No expected fixture labels are sent to the live provider.

## Design and limits

Two approaches were considered: extend the standalone generic schema proxy to
translate any schema to Jev, or add a narrow native adapter for the seven existing
scenes. The latter avoids changing public alias semantics or claiming support for
arbitrary schemas. It reuses scene descriptions and validators, adds no dependency,
and uses one upstream round trip per item. Its tradeoff is an explicit local
mapping for rubric scoring rather than a universal schema translator.

Cerebras produces one joint schema completion; Jev evaluates native questions.
Those are different inference tasks even with the same input/output application.
Latency or fixture-agreement comparisons must record that distinction and the
question count. No quality, calibration or speed parity is claimed.

Native responses must have exactly the requested answer IDs and types, every
Choice probability key, finite probabilities/confidence in [0,1], and a selected
maximum-probability option. Distribution sums tolerate at most 0.001 rounding
drift; native values are never normalized or rewritten. Bad output fails closed.
Requests have a 16-second deadline, bounded bodies and five-request admission;
cancellation propagates, permits are released on failure, and there are no retries,
repair or fallback to Cerebras. Upstream error bodies and credentials are not exposed.

Jev estimates use **$0.04 per million input tokens, free output**, supplied by the
account owner on 2026-09-17. Reported token usage is real; the displayed arithmetic
is an estimate, not an invoice. Failed/canceled requests with unknown usage are
excluded and may still be billed. Fixture mode is explicitly labeled, uses
synthetic probabilities/tokens and costs zero.

Offline HTTP-stub tests cover all seven scenes, credential isolation, native
payloads, answer validation, deadlines/cancellation, overload, error sanitization,
no retries and pricing semantics. The integration smoke test is limited to one
synthetic request per scene; it is not a full-theater benchmark. The existing
[Cerebras benchmark](benchmarks/README.md) remains unchanged.

## Live integration smoke — 2026-09-17

Seven synthetic requests through the demo runtime reached real **jev-1.13.0**;
all seven returned complete, validated outputs. Reported usage was **6,705
input / 770 output tokens**, estimated **$0.00026820** at the supplied
price. No warmup, retries or fallback; this was one request per scene, not a full
reel or latency comparison. [Requests, native responses and timings](jev-smoke.json).

The home answer set the requested kitchen to bright and also returned hall=bright
instead of unchanged. The hall was already bright, so the simulated state did not
change there; this remains a judgment mismatch, not a perfect-match claim.
Routing and driving were single decisions, not complete navigation/control runs.
The existing full Cerebras benchmark has not been replaced with these smoke results.
